Coffee Sales Case Study

This project analyzes point-of-sale transaction data from a chain of coffee shops to demonstrate end-to-end data science skills.

🔑 Objectives

Design a SQL Server database to store and query sales transactions.

Use Python (pandas, pyodbc, SQLAlchemy) for data cleaning, transformations, and feature engineering.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover sales trends, top products, and customer behavior.

Build machine learning models for:

Churn prediction (identify inactive customers)

Recommendation system (suggest products to customers)

Create visual dashboards with Power BI / Streamlit to present KPIs.

Apply Git version control for reproducible workflows.
